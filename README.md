MW Class Management

**Please note that this project is pre-alpha and is NOT ready to be deployed on a live/production site. Use it for testing purposes only!**

MW Class Management is a Sensei Extension that creates a new custom post type called Class, and uses it to allow users to create Classes that students and teachers can be added to.

While Sensei supports grouping Learners by Course or Lesson, for traditional classrooms, it can sometimes be necessary to also group students by Class, especially since many Classes could take the same courses.

I'm writing it because I need the functionality for some Sensei sites that I run, but hopefully it will be useful to others as well.
